# MBiP | Command-line bioinformatics

Over the next two workshops you will have an introduction to command-line bioinformatics. This is more difficult than using online tools but allows you greater control over what you're doing and at scale.

Command-line bioinformatics typically uses a Linux-based operating system, as this is open-source and makes software development easier. Most people and institutions don't have access to a local Linux computer, and therefore cloud computing has become more popular. This is where you connect to a computer virtually, while the physical computer is in a datacentre.

The most common command-line language for Linux is Bash, which we will be using today.

For these workshops, we are going to use Posit Cloud to do this. You may have already used this for R workshops, but it also has terminal access using Bash.

#### Getting set-up

1. Log into [Posit Cloud](https://login.posit.cloud/login?redirect=%2Foauth%2Fauthorize%3Fredirect_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fposit.cloud%252Flogin%26client_id%3Dposit-cloud%26response_type%3Dcode%26show_auth%3D0%26show_login%3D1)
2. Select 'New Project'
3. Select 'New Project from Git Repository'

GitHub is an online code repository frequently used for software development. You can store code here and easily download it onto a Linux computer using the command-line tool Git.

4. Paste in the following URL for the repository I have set up for the workshop. This will automatically download the material from the repository into the project.
